      My take on the EDA experience is that it is a very well developed and holistic yet fluid learning environment. I am really interested in how the course emphasises personal development hand in hand with technical learning at the same time.

        I'm really looking forward to getting invloved in such an open and dynamic learning environment as this is a novel approach for me that I feel will really suit how I learn and operate.

        I was initially very impressed with everything I had learned about EDA but now having passed the first week I see that the model is even more involved and cohesive than I had originally thought. As a result I am really excited by the challenges that lie ahead. 
        To be perfectly honest I am a little nervous about the course i.e. what's involved plus what I am to learn and improve about myself, although I feel it is a little like the nerves you feel before hopping on a rollercoaster. But in the end much like that fairground attraction I think we'll end up ecstatic, relieved and maybe even left with a little cleaning up to be done!
