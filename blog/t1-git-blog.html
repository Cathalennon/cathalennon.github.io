      Version control is a process of documenting and managing changes that have been made to a large project. Developers use version control in order for changes to be continuously documented. As a result if a bug is inadvertently introduced to the project, the section in question can be rolled back to the last previous “clean” change.

        Git tracks changes by comparing alterations that have been executed within a repository. When a change has been committed, a message is also associated with the specific commit.

        Github is a very effective place to store code for a number of reasons. When combined with Git it provides an integrated system for both editing and hosting code. By hosting code on Github it enables a fully collaborative platform by which a project's code can be altered and developed. This process also allows different parts within a project to be developed by different individuals simultaneously.
